#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("hello world!\n");
}

//clang in terminal to compile
//then use ./a.out (a.out will be the default name if wr dont specify it)
//clang -o programName file (we give it the name we wnat out program to be then the file)
// cli make fileName (same as above its a convinience program that will compile and name program for us)
//one wierd downside of data representation is that floats are still finite
//caused arian 5 rocket explosion and patriot missile exploded killing us soldiers
//permutation is the representation of 0 and 1's.
//overflow and inprecision cna cause terrible errors in programs


/*
impercision = 1/10 will give you .1000000055566 (ints not percice);
overflow if a number gets too large it can overflow into a negitive number.


\n for new line
\r for carage return
\" for quotes inside strings
\' same as above

= asignment operator
== equality operator

in C to compair a sing charictor or char we have to use single quotes. otherwise for strings we can use doublequotes


preprocesing: does the find ond replace
compileing: takes your sourse code ( C JS Python) and turns it into assembly code
asembling: turns your code into zeros and ones
linking: take all 0 and 1's and any other libraries we brought in adn give us one file of 0 and 1's.

half the struggle is getting better at seeing patterns and erros and working through thoughs patterns
